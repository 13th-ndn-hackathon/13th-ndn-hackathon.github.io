title: Welcome to the 13th NDN Hackathon
---

We are hosting a two-day NDN Hackathon (March 25-27, 2022). The event is open and free to participate in
and winners will receive exciting prizes! This event targets all levels of participants and,
particularly for beginners, will be an excellent opportunity to get started with NDN.

**Register for the hackathon** [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/13th-ndn-hackathon-registration-277692564937).

This year we are encouraging people to take a look at the [7 exciting categories]({% link hacks.md %})
of NDN topics we are planning to work on, but as always, we will be considering cool hacks submitted by
participants who wish to work on them!

We particularly encourage projects that:

- Directly address NDN research needs,
- Create new NDN tools or modify existing tools,
- Create or improve documentation and how-to guides.
